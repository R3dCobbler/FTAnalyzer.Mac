## FTAnalyzer.Mac Releases  

At present the Mac version of the program is not complete enough to be allowed to appear in the Apple App Store so for now I need to put a Apple Developer signed package version on this website. 

You can download a package zip file from the [releases page](https://github.com/ShammyLevva/FTAnalyzer.Mac/releases)

Note that you may need to change a setting to allow your Mac to run code signed by an Apple Developer that isn't from the Mac Store. Go to *Apple menu* > *System Preferences*, and then click on the *Security & Privacy* icon and change the setting to allow apps from the app store and from paid up members of the Apple Developer Community.

![Setting allow app install](http://mac.ftanalyzer.com/releases/IdentifiedDeveloper.png)

This will allow the app to install as normal.
