## FTAnalyzer.Mac Releases  

The Mac version of the program has been released on the Apple App Store however for beta versions I'll upload them here so beta testers can help eliminate bugs before launching on the app store.

You can download a package zip file from the [releases page](https://github.com/ShammyLevva/FTAnalyzer.Mac/releases)

Note that you may need to change a setting to allow your Mac to run code signed by an Apple Developer that isn't from the Mac Store. Go to *Apple menu* > *System Preferences*, and then click on the *Security & Privacy* icon and change the setting to allow apps from the app store and from paid up members of the Apple Developer Community.

![Setting allow app install](http://mac.ftanalyzer.com/releases/IdentifiedDeveloper.png)

This will allow the app to install as normal.
