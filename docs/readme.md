This is the Mac version of FTAnalyzer pages.

Please note that the development of the Mac version is still in a very early "alpha" stage. It can load a file and display individuals, families, sources, occupations and facts. 

I've also added the errors and fixes tab. This is quite basic at present as it doesnt yet have the filters that the windows version has and the duplicates isn't yet working. Little things like the column widths defaulting to the same width need addressed too.

More changes will be implemented over the comming months. However I'm aware that some folks want to test the features as they become available so I'll be releasing various alpha versions over the coming months.

You can find the latest Mac Release version [here](https://github.com/ShammyLevva/FTAnalyzer.Mac/releases)

Note that at the present time the app is available from this site and not the Apple App Store so you may need to change a system setting to allow the app to install. [This article](https://www.cultofmac.com/224876/safely-install-non-mac-app-store-apps-on-your-mac-os-x-tips/) may help explain how to do this.
