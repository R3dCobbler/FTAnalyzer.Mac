This is the Mac version of FTAnalyzer pages.

Please note that the development of the Mac version is still in a "beta" stage. It can load a file and display individuals, families, sources, occupations, facts and locations. 

I've also added the errors and fixes tab. This is quite basic at present as it doesnt yet have the filters that the windows version has and the duplicates isn't yet working. I've also added a double click to the lists to show all the facts for that person or family.

The latest version now includes a research suggestions tab that allows auto searching of census records on Ancestry, Find My Past, FamilySearch and FreeCen.

More changes will be implemented over the comming months. However I'm aware that some folks want to test the features as they become available so I'll be releasing various beta versions over the coming months. These beta versions will be released via the Mac App Store's TestFlight app. If you wish to take part in beta testing please email me via this site.

You can find the latest Mac Release version on the MacOS App Store for your region just search for FTAnalyzer. (note NOT the iPhone/iPad App Store)
