This is the Mac version of FTAnalyzer pages.

Please note that the development of the Mac version as of 7th March 2018 is still in a very early "alpha" stage. It can load a file and display individuals, families, sources, occupations and facts but doesn't do much else. This will gradually change over the comming months.

You can find the latest Mac Release version [here](https://github.com/ShammyLevva/FTAnalyzer.Mac/releases)
