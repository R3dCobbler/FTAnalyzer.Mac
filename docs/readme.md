This is the Mac version of FTAnalyzer pages.

Please note that the development of the Mac version is still in a very early "alpha" stage. It can load a file and display individuals, families, sources, occupations and facts. 

I've also added the errors and fixes tab. This is quite basis at present as it doesnt yet have the filters that the windows version has and the duplicates isn't yet working. Little things like the column widths defaulting to the same width need addressed too.

More changes will be implemented over the comming months. However I'm aware that some folks want to test the features as they become available so I'll be releasing various alpha versions over the coming months.
